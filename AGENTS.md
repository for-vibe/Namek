# AI Agent Best Practices

This repository uses AI agents to assist with development tasks. Follow these principles:

1. **Test-Driven Development**
   Implement features guided by tests. Write tests first whenever possible.
   Always write **automated tests** for new features and bug fixes.

2. **Run and Maintain Tests**
   Make sure all tests pass before committing.
   Regularly run the test suite during development and update or extend tests as needed.

3. **Version Management**
   **Bump the application version** with every meaningful change.

4. **Document Actions**
   Record all noteworthy decisions and actions in `HISTORY.md`.

5. **Write Clear Commits**
   Each commit message should be concise and descriptive.

6. **Keep Code Simple**
   Aim for readability and maintainability over cleverness.

7. **Automate When Reasonable**
   Use scripts and tools to automate repetitive tasks.
