# AI Agent Best Practices

This repository uses AI agents to assist with development tasks. Follow these principles:

1. **Test-Driven Development**: Implement features guided by tests. Write tests first whenever possible.
2. **Document Actions**: Record all noteworthy decisions and actions in `HISTORY.md`.
3. **Write Clear Commits**: Each commit message should be concise and descriptive.
4. **Keep Code Simple**: Aim for readability and maintainability over cleverness.
5. **Automate When Reasonable**: Use scripts and tools to automate repetitive tasks.
